## Rationale
BoardGameGeek is a useful resource for boardgame information. We want to build a webpage to visualize the data related to board games. 

## Functionality
The index.html page will load with the news Board Gaming News scrapped from boardgamegeek.com. 
A user can choose a game from dropdown menus based on a minimum number of players, game categories, minimum ages of players, etc. Then the web page will load several horizontal bar graphs with the top ten games with their average rankings based on the user input. 
The user can choose daily rankings from a drop-down menu. A top 200 game list will load on the page. A breakdown of the categories in the pie chart will be plotted.
